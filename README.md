**Project Description:**

This repository contains a digit classification project implemented using the MNIST dataset. The goal of the project is to classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Initially, we explored the dataset and preprocessed the images, including feature scaling to normalize the pixel values. For classification, we employed the Random Forest classifier, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm known for its robustness and versatility. Through extensive experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, we achieved an impressive accuracy of 96%, showcasing the efficacy of the Random Forest approach for this task.

**Key Features:**

- Utilizes the MNIST dataset for digit classification.
- Implements feature scaling to normalize pixel values.
- Employs the Random Forest classifier for the classification task.
- Achieves an accuracy of 96% through hyperparameter tuning and optimization.
- Offers insights into the preprocessing steps and model selection process.
- Provides a comprehensive overview of the project workflow and results.
